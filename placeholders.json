    "PLACEHOLDER_FAQ_TITLE": "Frequently Asked Questions About Ethereum Transaction Analysis",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_1": "What is Ethereum transaction analysis?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_1": "Ethereum transaction analysis involves monitoring and decoding data from the Ethereum blockchain to gain insights into new transactions as they occur in real-time. This allows tracking of ether transfers, smart contract deployments, and interactions with decentralized applications (dApps).",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_2": "How can I analyze new Ethereum transactions?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_2": "You can analyze new Ethereum transactions by connecting to an Ethereum node and streaming incoming block data. From there, you can decode the transaction data to extract details like the sender, recipient, value transferred, and any associated data payloads.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_3": "What are some use cases for Ethereum transaction analysis?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_3": "Ethereum transaction analysis enables real-time alerting on transactions of interest, tracking activity for security monitoring, analyzing adoption of specific dApps or tokens, and extracting on-chain data for analytics and business intelligence.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_4": "How can I get started with Ethereum transaction analysis?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_4": "To get started, you'll need access to an Ethereum node (local or cloud-based) and tools/libraries to decode and parse the transaction data. Open source libraries like web3.js can help interact with Ethereum nodes from code. Managed services also offer transaction monitoring out-of-the-box.",
