The AI, acknowledging these requests, also offered a list of additional features for implementation, including a real-time Ethereum transaction tracker, filter options for transactions, and a blockchain explorer among others. Some features like interactive graphs for transaction analysis and notification alerts for high-value transactions were not checked, indicating the user might not want them. Further, the user expressed interest in adding a \"Hello World\" button, inquiring about its placement within the app interface and the action it should trigger upon being pressed. The conversation then shifted to the AI asking the user to provide more details about the project to better understand its scope and requirements.",
