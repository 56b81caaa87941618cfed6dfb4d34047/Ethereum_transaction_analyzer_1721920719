The AI, acknowledging these requests, also offered a list of additional features for implementation, including a real-time Ethereum transaction tracker, filter options for transactions, and a blockchain explorer among others. Some features like interactive graphs for transaction analysis and notification alerts for high-value transactions were not checked, indicating the user might not want them. Further, the user expressed interest in adding a \"Hello World\" button, inquiring about its placement within the app interface and the action it should trigger upon being pressed. The conversation then shifted to the AI asking the user to provide more details about the project to better understand its scope and requirements.\nAI: Got it, adding a button that says hello world.\nAI: Working on adding a navbar with home, about and contact.\nUser: add a navbar with the navlinks home, about and contacrt\nAI: Working on adding a button with \"Hello World\".\nUser: add a button that says hello world\nThis is the user's current request of changes to be made: add a button that says hello world"
